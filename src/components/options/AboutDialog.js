                    <b>Name and purpose</b>
                    <br />HIC is an application for Hindu Calendar Conversion. It was essentially designed to meet
the needs of J. C. Eade in his research on the calendrical systems and chronology of
Southeast Asia, particularly medieval Cambodia and Java. But it should be quite useful for scholars working in
other parts of Asia where Hindu calendars have been in use.

                    <b>Version history and licensing</b>
                    <br />HIC was originally programmed in Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8.0_20 by L. Gislén &amp; J. C.
Eade. The last version (copyright © 2007) curated by Gislén &amp; Eade was 2.0. This was
released as freeware via <a href="http://home.thep.lu.se/~larsg/Site/download.html">http://home.thep.lu.se/~larsg/Site/download.html</a>.
<div style={{marginTop: 8}}>The code for HIC 2.0 was translated into a web application in JavasSript by Toni Kustiana
under supervision of Arlo Griffiths. The most important changes are streamlining of redundancies in the
application, transformation of Wuku Search into an infinite loop, adaptation of
the Manual, addition of save buttons for Day, Planet and Time windows,
addition of a <i>devatā</i> column to the Nakṣatra table, addition of tables for Wuku,
Muhūrta and Rāśi. The resulting version 3.0 (copyright © 2023) or any
later version are released as free software. The source code can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/arlogriffiths/hic">https://github.com/arlogriffiths/hic</a> under a fully free license, meaning that it may be
reused in any way. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate for the authorship of L. Gislén &amp; J.
C. Eade, the programming by Toni Kustiana, and the funding furnished by the EFEO
always to be duly acknowledged.</div>

                    <br />The development of version 3.0 was funded by the EFEO in the framework of the project
DHARMA ‘The Domestication of “Hindu” Asceticism and the Religious Making of South
and Southeast Asia’. This project has received funding from the European Research
Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
programme (grant agreement no 809994).
